### 🍄 Hi! My name is Liza

---

I'm a junior frontend developer working on my own projects right now. Always open to new ideas, new knowledge and new interesting people so let me know if you have something to talk about 👀

My stack is **HTML / CSS / JS / REACT / Tilda** and I'm currently learning Typescript and Vue.js ( bcz who doesn't, right? 😀)

Addicted to books, mycology and any types of outdoor activities.
